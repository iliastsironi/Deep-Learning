Viewer Engagement Prediction during Live Video Streaming Events

I analyze these things:
• Viewer engagement over time during an event. You will have to select to
visualize only a subset of viewers, but you will have to justify why you
selected this subset. 
• Viewer’s qoe over time during an event. Similarly, you will have to select
to visualize only a subset of viewers, but you will have to justify why you
selected this subset. 
• Viewers’ engagement level duration. In particular, we are interested to
visualize how much time each viewer remains in the same engagement
level. Viewer engagement should be discretized to 5 different levels (Bad,
Poor, Average, Good, Excellent). 
• Viewers’ engagement level duration over country/city/viewer type.
• Correlations between the data points.
• Correlations between viewer engagement and the following factors: i)
Number of viewers during the event, ii) Day of the event, iii) Duration of
the event, iv) Countries, v) Viewers’ retention (how much time did each
viewer participated in the event).
